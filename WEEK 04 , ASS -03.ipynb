    "The `abc` module in Python stands for **Abstract Base Classes**. It is part of Python's standard library and is used to define abstract classes and methods, which are the foundation of abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is the `abc` module used?\n",
    "- The `abc` module allows the creation of **abstract classes**â€”classes that cannot be instantiated directly. These abstract classes define a blueprint for other classes.\n",
    "- Abstract classes contain **abstract methods**, which are methods that do not have an implementation in the base class but must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
    "- This promotes the use of **abstraction** in Python, where concrete (derived) classes must provide the implementation details for abstract methods.\n",
    "- It ensures that a derived class implements the required methods, which guarantees that certain behaviors are provided in a consistent way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Abstract Classes**: You can create a class that serves as a template for other classes, enforcing that derived classes implement specific methods.\n",
    "2. **Abstract Methods**: You can define methods that don't have any implementation in the base class and must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "3. **@abstractmethod decorator**: This decorator is used to declare a method as abstract, meaning subclasses must override it.\n",

    "### How the `abc` module works:\n",

    "### Benefits of Data Abstraction:\n",
    "- **Simplifies interaction**: Users interact with a simplified interface without needing to understand the internal workings.\n",
    "- **Improves maintainability**: Internal implementations can be changed without affecting the external interface.\n",
    "- **Increases security**: Data is hidden and can only be accessed through well-defined methods, preventing unintended or harmful interactions with the internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, data abstraction in Python can be achieved by combining abstract classes, encapsulation, and getter/setter methods. This allows developers to expose only the necessary functionalities while hiding the underlying complexity."

    "No, **we cannot create an instance of an abstract class** in Python (or in most Object-Oriented Programming languages). An abstract class serves as a blueprint for other classes, and its purpose is to provide a base structure with abstract methods that must be implemented by any concrete (derived) class. Instantiating an abstract class directly would defeat the purpose of abstraction, which is to ensure that certain methods are implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why can't we instantiate an abstract class?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstract methods**: An abstract class typically contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared but not implemented in the abstract class. Since the abstract class doesn't provide a complete implementation for these methods, creating an instance of the class wouldn't make sense. The class is incomplete by design, and thus, cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subclass responsibility**: The subclass is responsible for providing the concrete implementation of the abstract methods. Only when the subclass implements all the abstract methods, the object can be instantiated from that class.\n",
